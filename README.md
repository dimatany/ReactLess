# Pet Project.
## _The website of the Beauty Salon with the cosmetics store._

**[Reference to the visual part](https://reactbs1.netlify.app/about)**

The project was created from the first days of study the React Library.
As I deepen my knowledge, I am changing the code again and again, correct it and amend it.
I'm going to describe the components that I have already been implemented in the project and those that are still planning to be implemented in the future.


## Features
***Implemented features***

- **Tab component** - which consists of adaptive clickable tabs placed next to each other.
- **Multiple filter** - that helps filter cards with the goods on the Product page.
- **Countdown component** - which counts the time to the end of the promotion.
- **Paganization** of articles and a block of comments for clients.
- **Google Map component** - where you can find accommodation for the arrival point.
- **Modal window** in button where you can find the **Form of sending messages** to managers of Beauty Salon.
- **Theme switch button** on the website - from dark to light and revers.

***Planning features***
- The **click button** to which I will receive the **translation of the texts** on the website.
- **Like component** - of the product card or article or commentary on the website.
- **Form of logging/registration** - of the user on the website.
- **Store Basket**.
- **Payment of goods component**.

## Tech

I used the following libraries during the project:

- [Official EmailJS SDK for Browsers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@emailjs/browser)
- [React Show More](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tedconf/react-show-more)
- [react-burger-menu](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-burger-menu)
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
- [ReactJS component to render a pagination.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-paginate)
- [react-google-maps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-google-maps/api)
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org)
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
- [React Hook Form](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hook-form)
- [React Router DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)


I understand that some libraries might not be used in the project, but my task was to learn how to use libraries as well.

### What I learned during the project.
> I can write the perfect component - back to the code in a week and say, God, who wrote it?

> When I was creating this project, all decisions are made on my self, I used Google to help! This is a great skill, since before me, someone has already met a similar problem.

>I learned to stop in time in the attacks of perfectionism and write the code further. Even if I think the code is not ideal, it works well.
