# Pet Project.
## _The website of the Beauty Salon with the cosmetics store._

**[Reference to the visual part](https://reactbs1.netlify.app/about)**


The project was started during first days of my study of the React Library. 
As I deepen my knowledge, I am changing the code over and over again, correcting it and modifying it.
I'm going to describe the components that have already been implemented in the project and those that are still planned to be implemented in the future.


## Features
***Implemented features***

- **Tab component** - which consists of adaptive clickable tabs placed next to each other.
- **Multiple item filter** - that helps filtering cards with the goods on the Product page.
- **Countdown component** - which counts the time to the end of the promotion.
- **Pagination** of articles and a section of customer comments.
- **Google Map component** - where you can find accommodation for the arrival destination.
- **Modal window** - button where you can find the **Form to send messages** to managers of Beauty Salon.
- **Theme switch button** - from dark to light and reverse.

***Planning features***
- **A button to translate the text on the website**.
- **'Like' component** - for the product card or article or comment on the website.
- **Login/registration form**.
- **Store Basket**.
- **Payment component**.

## Tech

I used the following libraries during the project:

- [Official EmailJS SDK for Browsers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@emailjs/browser)
- [React Show More](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tedconf/react-show-more)
- [react-burger-menu](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-burger-menu)
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
- [ReactJS component to render a pagination.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-paginate)
- [react-google-maps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-google-maps/api)
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org)
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
- [React Hook Form](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hook-form)
- [React Router DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)


I understand that some libraries might not be needed in the project, but  one of my objectives was to learn how to use these libraries.

### What I learned during the project.
> I can write the perfect component, then get  - to the code in a week and say, God, who wrote it?

> When I was creating this project, all decisions were made on my own, I used Google to help! This is a great skill, since before me, someone has already met a similar problem.

>I learned to stop in time in the attacks of perfectionism and write the code further. Even if I think the code is not ideal, it works well.
